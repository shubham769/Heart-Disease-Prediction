Problem statement

We are given with various clinical parameters of a patient and we have to predict whether or not she is suffereing from heart disease.

Features

Age (age in years)

Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)

CP (chest pain type)

TRESTBPS (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))

CHOL (serum cholestoral in mg/dl)

FPS (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

RESTECH (resting electrocardiographic results)

THALACH (maximum heart rate achieved)

EXANG (exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no))

OLDPEAK (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)

SLOPE (the slope of the peak exercise ST segment)

CA (number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy)

THAL (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

TARGET (1 or 0)

Solution

Built a successful machine learning model which could predict results.
